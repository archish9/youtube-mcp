read @advanced-features.txt and want a new feature "Channel Comparison Tools" and want have all these tools in my MCP server

Compare multiple YouTube channels side-by-side

Analyze content strategies

Benchmark performance metrics

Identify competitive advantages

Track market share

once you create tools I want to show how to use these tools, i don't want unit test, i want actual scripts that show how to pass arguments and see response. read @README.md file so you follow the structure to create and name these testing scripts.
So create a new folder in examples folder generate the required scripts and readme.md files. these folder is exclusive for "Channel Comparison Tools" feature.

please check the current project and follow the current project structure for coding, testing files and readme content.
